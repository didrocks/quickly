QUICKLY
=======

Quickly is a set of choices about writing apps for Ubuntu. Out of all the
wonderful richness and variety of programming for Linux, Quickly make some
very opinionated choices about what tools to use, and how to combine them.
The criteria for these choices was to make it easy and fun to write and
release Linux applications, even if it's your first time trying, but also
in a way that delivers the full power and flexibility of the platform.
One benefit of these choices, is that it's also easier to write tools that
make it even easier and more fun. So Quickly is also a set of commands.
Currently there is only one template, for Ubuntu Projects.

However, it is easy to create your own templates for other kinds of projects.
So if you are a fan of language, you can create a foo-project template.
Or if you want to help people making plugins for your killer app, you can
make a killer-app-plugin template, etc...
