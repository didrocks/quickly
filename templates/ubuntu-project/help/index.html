    <H1>What is Quickly?</H1>
    <P>
        Quickly is a set of choices about writing apps for Ubuntu. Out of all the wonderful richness and variety of programming for Linux, Quickly make some very opinionated choices about what tools to use, and how to combine them. The criteria for these choices was to make it easy and fun to write and release Linux applications, even if it's your first time trying. One benefit of these choices, is that it's also easier to write tools that make it even easier and more fun. So Quickly is also a set of commands.
