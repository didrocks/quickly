<H1>What is Quickly?</H1>

<H1>Installing Quickly</H1>

<H1>The Goal Project</H1>

<H1>Creating a Quickly Project</H1>
<H2>Creating the Empty Project</H2>
Creating an empty but working program couldn't be simpler. First, open a terminal window to type commands into. When it's open, type the command:
<DIV class="termnial">
$quickly new ubuntu-project super_text
</DIV>
<IMG SRC="./images/terminal1.png" ALT="type 'quickly new ubuntu-project super_text' into terminal" />
This will create a super_text sub directory containing a complete directory tree and files for an empty python appliction. The command finishes by running the newly created empty application.
<IMG SRC="./images/application1.png" ALT="The command finishes by running the empty application." />

<H2>Testing the Empty Application</H2>
The are populated and set up, and you can resize the window. Notice that quickly interfered that the application title is "Super Text". Only a few of menu items do anything in the empty application, Help->About, Edit->Preferences, and File->Quit.
<IMG SRC="./images/application2.png" ALT="The menus are populated and set up." />

<H2>Running the Applicatin</H2>
Close the application by closing the window or using the Quit command. Since the empty application isn't installed into Ubuntu yet, you can't start the application from the application menu yet. To start the applicaton, use the terminal to first cd into the new subdirectory, and then issue the command to start the program.
<DIV class="termnial">
$cd super_text
super_text$./super_text
</DIV>
<IMG SRC="./images/terminal3.png" ALT="run the empty application from the terminal" />

<H2>Edit the User Interface</H2>
Quickly programs use Glade to edit the user interface. Start Glade with quickly in order to set up Glade for editing the empty applicaton. Don't start glade directly, or it won't load the necessary catalogue files for editing the classes that were automaticaly generated by quickly.
<DIV class="termnial">
super_text$quickly glade
</DIV>
<IMG SRC="./images/terminal4.png" ALT="start glade with the 'quickly glade' command " />
Glade will open with the project loaded up and ready to edit.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade1.png" ALT="glade loads the project " />
Use the Project Menu to choose "SuperTextWindow.ui" for editing.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade2.png" ALT="choose SuperTextWindow.ui from the project menu " />
We want to create a text area for typing into. There are some default Widgets added to the Window. We won't need these so we'll start with deleting them. Click on the label, and press delete, and it will disappear from the window.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade3.png" ALT="select the label" />

<IMG SRC="./images/glade4.png" ALT="delete the label from the window" />
Do the same with the image widget.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade4.png" ALT="select the image" />
<IMG SRC="./images/glade5.png" ALT="delete the image from the window" />
This leave us two free slots.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade6.png" ALT="two empty slots in the window" />
We'll use the bottom slot to add a TextView widget for the user to type into. In the toolbox, click on the TextView widget. Then click in the empty slot.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade7.png" ALT="click on the text view widget" />
<IMG SRC="./images/glade6.png" ALT="click in the empty slot" />
Make sure you save the file in Glade, or your changes won't take! Then run the application from terminal again. The window now has a place where the user can type.
<IMG SRC="./images/application3.png" ALT="the applicaton permits typing" />

<H2>Add the Save, Open, and New Features</H2>
After the user types something, they may want to save it. A File->Save menu item was automatically created in the empty was created, but it's not hooked up to any code. To make Save work, we need tell the menu item what function to call, and then create a funtion to actually do the saving.

<H3>Set the Signal Handler in Glade</H3>
To tell the menu item what function to call, open up the window in glade:
<DIV class="termnial">
super_text$quickly glade
</DIV>
Click on the file menu, and the menu opens as if the application were running.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade7.png" ALT="choose the menu item" />

Choose the Save menu item, and it will be selected in Glade.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade8.png" ALT="the menu item is selcted in glade" />

Then choose the "Signals" tab of the properties window.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade8.png" ALT="signals tab in glade" />
In pygtk, menu items are "activated" when a user chooses the item from the menu.  Since we want a function to run when the user chooses Save, we want to specify a function to respond to the activate signal from the menu item. We'll call the function "save". Simply type the function name into the box for the activate signal. Make sure to save the glade file.
<IMG SRC="./images/glade9.png" ALT="activate signal set to 'save'" />

<H3>Implement the Save Function</H3>
Of course, this won't make the file actually save, because we haven't created the "save" function yet. So it's time to write a little code.

The code for SuperTextWindow is stored in the file SuperTextWindow.py. 
<DIV class="note">
Notice the relationship, SuperTextWindow.ui and SuperTextWindow.py. These two files always work tog.ether to make your program work. The .ui file stores the presentation of the window, while the .py file stores the behavior.
</DIV>

Use the quickly edit command to start editing your code files:
<DIV class="termnial">
super_text$quickly edit
</DIV>
This will open the default Ubuntu text editor "Gedit" with any python files in the python directory. In this case, just SuperTextWindow.py and about.py.
<IMG SRC="./images/gedit1.png" ALT="python files ready to edit" />

SuperTextWindow.ui is now expecting to find a function SuperTextWindow.save(), so we simply add one to the SuperTextWindow class:
<DIV class="code">
 def save(self, widget, data=None):
    print "save"
</DIV>
This will print the word "save" to the terminal when run. The method signature is the standard signature expected in a signal handler. If you are new to python, be sure to follow the indentations exactly, as the indentation level is very important in python.

    d. respond to the save command
    e. save the file
    f. respond to the open command
    g. load the file
    h. respond to the new command
    i. clear it out

3. Save your work
    1. commit it
    2. create a launchpad account
    3. push it
    4. pull it

4. package it
    1. edit setup.py
    1. quickly package
    2. run the deb
    3. try it out
    
4. Make a PPA
    1. already editted setup.py
    2. already have a launchpad acocunt
    3. quickly release
